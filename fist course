Network socket : like a phone call on the Internet: connect - talk - disconnect
TCP connection/ socket
actually app talks to app, need TCP port number to know what app is talking, for example web sever: 80, HTTPS: 443

!!SIMPLE BROWSER IN pythhon:

import socket
mysocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)            #first create a socket then it is like bulit a end-point, it is like "build a phone"
mysocket.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))                                 #it is like making a phone call to this end-point
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/page1.html HTTP1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()    #send them in UTF-8 string
mysocket.send(cmd)

while True:
  data = mysocket.recv(512)
  if len(data) < 1:
    break
  print(data.decode().end='')

mysocket.close()
